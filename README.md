Unique Build Information
========================
This activity is unique because it is a "library" type activity. It does not actually do anything itself, and it is not deployed an Interactive Spaces controller. Instead, once built, this activity should be copied into the "bootstrap" directory of your local controller, making the library available while building other activites which depend upon it.
